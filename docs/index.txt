It is a fast paced, 1v1 multiplayer FPS arena game played in best of 5 rounds of collecting most points. Points are received from collecting orbs and hitting the opponent by releasing a charged up, long range laser.\n    \n    The player who utilizes the abilites of dashing and sending clone decoys has a chance to outplay their opponent around the main mechanic: <b>stealth</b>.\n    Each player is assigned a color, the map is separated into parts with the same colors which turns the player invisible when matching. Becoming stealthed is a huge advantage, but to reach the collectable orbs the players must reveal themselves.\n    \n    During playtest and showcase, we have been fortunate to receive a lot of
